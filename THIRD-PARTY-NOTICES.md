# Third-party notices

AbX2T (Copyright (C) 2026 Hugo Lagouardat, [Abend-core](https://github.com/Abend-core) project)
is distributed under the [GNU AGPLv3](LICENSE) license. This file documents the third-party
components bundled in this repository, their licenses, and where to find their corresponding
source code, in accordance with AGPLv3 obligations (section 6, "Corresponding Source").

## ONLYOFFICE (x2t, sdkjs)

- **Publisher**: Ascensio System SIA — <https://www.onlyoffice.com>
- **Copyright**: (C) Ascensio System SIA.
- **License**: [GNU AGPLv3](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/core/blob/master/LICENSE) (same
  license as this repository)
- **Bundled components**:
  - `x2t/bin/windows-x86_64/`: the `x2t.exe` binary and its DLLs (conversion engine), version
    **9.4.0.129** (read from the binary's own metadata). Bundled format converters (DjVuFile,
    HwpFile, OFDFile, IWork, StarMath2OOXML, XpsFile, etc.): all present in ONLYOFFICE/core's
    public source tree — no proprietary or undocumented "black box" component.
  - `x2t/bin/macos-arm64/`: the same `x2t` binary and its `.framework` bundles, macOS build of
    the same conversion engine, sourced from an official ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors release.
  - `x2t/sdkjs/`: JavaScript runtime (word/cell/slide/visio/pdf/common) of the same SDK.
    `x2t/sdkjs/common/AllFonts.js` is not upstream code: it is a font index generated locally
    on each machine by `allfontsgen`.
- **Provenance**: components are taken as-is from an official ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors
  installation (see `x2t/build/scripts/sync_from_install_windows.ps1` and
  `sync_from_release.sh`). **No modification** is made to these binaries or JS files: AbX2T
  only packages them and invokes them as a subprocess from its own code
  (`convert/convert/Program.cs`).
- **Corresponding source** (exact version match): ONLYOFFICE publishes the source for this
  exact version under AGPLv3, tagged `v9.4.0.129`:
  - <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/core/releases/tag/v9.4.0.129>
  - <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs/releases/tag/v9.4.0.129>
  - Desktop application shell (not bundled here, for reference):
    <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors>

  AbX2T does not republish this source code (already public and maintained by ONLYOFFICE);
  should it become unavailable, contact this repository's maintainer (see README) for a copy.
- **Third-party libraries inside the ONLYOFFICE binaries**: the x2t binaries statically embed
  several libraries under their own (permissive or weak-copyleft) licenses, as documented
  upstream in [ONLYOFFICE/core `3DPARTY.md`](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/core/blob/master/3DPARTY.md)
  — notably ICU (`icudt74.dll`, `icuuc74.dll`; Unicode License v3), FreeType (FTL), HarfBuzz
  (MIT), Boost (BSL), V8 (BSD-3-Clause), hunspell/hyphen (MPL), OpenSSL (Apache-2.0), and
  others. See that file for the complete list and license texts. `x2t/sdkjs/vendor/` also
  contains [XRegExp](https://github.com/slevithan/xregexp) (MIT, Copyright (C) Steven
  Levithan).

## ONLYOFFICE/core source subset (allfontsgen)

- **Publisher**: Ascensio System SIA — <https://www.onlyoffice.com>
- **License**: [GNU AGPLv3](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/core/blob/master/LICENSE) (same
  license as this repository)
- **What's bundled**: `allfontsgen/src/` is a vendored copy of a subset of the
  [ONLYOFFICE/core](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/core) source tree (`Common/`,
  `DesktopEditor/`, `OdfFile/`, `UnicodeConverter/`), copied in verbatim by
  `allfontsgen/build/scripts/sync_core.sh`. It is compiled locally into `allfontsgen`, a
  small tool used to index system fonts into `AllFonts.js`. Unlike x2t/sdkjs above, this
  source is committed directly in this repository (not just referenced), which is the
  simplest way to guarantee the Corresponding Source travels with the binary built from it.
- **Modification**: at build time, `allfontsgen/build/scripts/prepare_generated_sources.sh`
  (macOS/Linux) and `build_windows.ps1` (Windows, inline) apply a small patch to one file,
  `DesktopEditor/fontengine/ApplicationFontsWorker.cpp`: they wrap the `SaveThumbnails`
  function body and its raster/graphics includes behind an
  `ALLFONTSGEN_DISABLE_THUMBNAILS` preprocessor guard, so `allfontsgen` can build without
  pulling in thumbnail-rendering dependencies it doesn't need. The patch is applied to a
  generated copy under `allfontsgen/build/generated/` (not committed); the vendored copy
  under `allfontsgen/src/` stays untouched. The exact patch is fully visible and
  reproducible by reading those two scripts — no hidden or undocumented change.
- **FreeType**: the vendored subset includes FreeType 2.10.4
  (`allfontsgen/src/DesktopEditor/freetype-2.10.4/`), which is compiled into
  `allfontsgen` and used under the
  [FreeType License (FTL)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/blob/master/docs/FTL.TXT).
  As required by the FTL: *Portions of this software are copyright © The FreeType Project
  (<https://www.freetype.org>). All rights reserved.*
- **Corresponding source**: the unmodified upstream version of every file, including
  `ApplicationFontsWorker.cpp`, is available at <https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/core>.

## AbX2T original code

Everything else in this repository (the `Abx2t.exe` C# code, sync/build scripts,

is original work by Hugo Lagouardat (Abend-core), published under the
same AGPLv3 license — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
